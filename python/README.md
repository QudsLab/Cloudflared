## Cloudflared Python Utilities

This folder contains Python utilities for working with Cloudflared tunnels, VPN detection, and binary management.

### Features
- Check internet connectivity
- Detect VPN/tunnel usage
- Download platform-specific cloudflared binaries
- Manage Cloudflare tunnels (start/stop)

### Usage Example

```bash
python main.py
```

See the `dcft/` folder for more advanced usage and scripts.

### Package Ideas
- Maybe we will launch like other D-TOR or D-POW or D-PQC a Python package on PyPI on D-CFT (dcft - Dev's Cloudflare Tunnel)
